slice_tensor = tensor[:2, :]
is tensor slicing — it extracts a subset of elements from tensor without copying the entire data (view-based operation in most cases).

Breaking it down
Assume tensor is 2D (like a matrix) with shape (rows, columns):

:2 → row selection

: means "start from the beginning"
2 means "up to but not including index 2"
So it selects rows with indices 0 and 1.
: (second position) → column selection

: alone means "take all columns".
