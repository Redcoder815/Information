Recommended Machine Learning Projects (2026)
Based on the algorithms you've already mastered, here are three project ideas that will bridge the gap to deep learning:

Predictive Maintenance for IoT Devices: Use your knowledge of Random Forest or SVM to predict equipment failure. This project is highly valued in 2026 for its practical application in smart manufacturing.

Real-Time Customer Churn Prediction: Utilize Logistic Regression and Random Forest to identify customers likely to cancel a subscription. Focus on feature engineering, which is a core skill before moving to deep learning.

Traffic Flow Prediction: Apply your Multiple Linear Regression and KNN skills to forecast city congestion levels. This project introduces you to time-series data, preparing you for sequence models in deep learning.
